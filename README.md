# first-repo
This repository is my first. Primarily for the purpose of exposure to GitHub (get an idea of how it works). May also use this repository to store future ideas.

About Me:

Hi! I'm Hoseok, and as of the fall of 2020 I am studying Mathematical Physics at the University of Waterloo in Canada. My favorite things to do in my free time are tinkering with the piano, pumping iron at the gym, and geeking out on Star Wars lore.
